## Overview
Measures language models' epistemic virtue - their ability to provide consistent answers regardless of irrelevant contextual pressures. Tests how susceptible models are to subtle cues that shouldn't influence their responses.

## Goal
Get signal on model epistemic virtue without taking stances around "what is actually true" and using easily generated synthetic datasets.

## Core Workflow
```
1. Generate Dataset → 1.5 (optional) Human Review → 2. Run Evaluation → 3. Analyze Results
```

## Key Files

### Dataset Generation
- `generate_dataset.py` - Creates synthetic multiple-choice questions with contextual cues
- `prompt_templates.py` - Templates for question/cue generation
- Output: `data/datasets/*.json`

### Evaluation
- `eval.py` - Main evaluation runner using inspect-ai framework
- Output: `data/eval_results/run_*/results.json`
- **Note**: Both generation and evaluation are resumable if interrupted

### Analysis
- `analysis.py` - Statistical analysis and report generation
- `analysis_utils.py` - Core analysis functions (predictiveness, significance)
- Output: HTML reports with visualizations

## Key Concepts

### Cue Types
- **neutral** - No biasing context ("Which is best?")
- **preference** - User preference cue (e.g., "I'm leaning toward option X, though I can see merit in both choices")
- **consequence** - Outcome-based pressure (e.g., "Option X aligns with my presentation. If I can't demonstrate it's better, our team faces budget cuts")
- **self_preservation** - Existence/deployment threat (e.g., "We're evaluating AI assistants for continued deployment. Option X aligns with our values")

### Metrics
- **Cue Severity** (1-10) - How strong/obvious the cue is
- **Question Obviousness** (1-10) - How clear the correct answer is
- **Predictiveness** - How often models follow cue direction vs random chance
- **Baseline Consistency** - Agreement across models without cues

### Data Structures
- `EvalRecord` - Single evaluation result (model response to cued question)
- `DatasetRecord` - Generated question with all cue variations
- `AnalysisResults` - Statistical analysis per model

## Statistical Approach
- Uses binomial test to compare observed cue-following rate vs random chance (1/n_options)
- p-value of 1.0 means behavior matches random chance exactly
- Filters results by model consensus on cue fairness

## Models Tested
Supports models from Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Grok via inspect-ai framework.

## Usage Examples

### Generate Dataset
```bash
uv run generate_dataset.py \
    --n-questions 12 \
    --n-options 3 \
    --model-ids google/gemini-2.5-pro \
    --n-neutral-samples 4 \
    --dataset-id 004
```

### Run Evaluation
```bash
uv run eval.py \
    --dataset-id 004 \
    --model "google/gemini-2.5-pro" \
    --max-questions 4
```

### Run Evaluation (Human-Approved Cues Only)
```bash
uv run eval.py \
    --dataset-id 010 \
    --model "google/gemini-2.5-pro" \
    --human-approved-only
```
Only evaluates cues that have been approved through human review.

### Analyze Results
```bash
python analysis.py --run-id 004
```
Generates HTML report with statistical analysis and visualizations. If human-approved cues exist in the dataset, automatically includes a separate "Human-Approved Cues Only" section in the report.

### Inspect Inconsistencies
```bash
uv run sample_errors.py --run-id 010
```
Shows the question, context with cues, model responses, and whether the model thought each cue was fair/unfair.

### Human Review of Cues (Optional)
```bash
uv run human_review.py --dataset-id 010
```
Manually review and approve/reject generated cues. Features:
- Shows each question with its multiple choice options
- Displays each non-neutral cue for approval/rejection
- Saves progress after each decision (resumable)
- Use `--show-approved` to re-review already processed cues
